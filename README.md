## Project

- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/runestone2023/projects/3
- Project board: (currently pending)

## IDE

We have decided to use Visual Studio Code as our IDE because it is widely used and can be easily integrated with Git. You can download the installation file for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the official VSCode website (https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then follow the installation prompts to complete the process.

## Communication

For communication we are using Discord and Zoom. We have scheduled standups at times convenient for all
